    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Cube Algs is a place to share and learn new algorithms for solving the Rubiks Cube using the Fridrich method.</p>
    <p>My intention is not to provide a guide to solving the Rubiks cube, but instead for those who already know how to solve the rubiks cube, perhaps with a beginners method, to be able to learn the Fridrich method. If you already know the Fridrich method, then I hope you find the algorithms listed here useful.</p>
    <p>If you have learned to solve the Rubiks Cube with a Beginners method, I recommend learning 2 look OLL and 2 look PLL next. (I have no content to describe this yet so you'll need to search on google or youtube)
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The Fridrich method of solving the Rubiks cube is generally described as 4 steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cross</li>
      <li>F2L (First 2 Layers)</li>
      <li>OLL (Orientation of the last layer)</li>
      <li>PLL (Permutation of the last layer)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ultimate goal of the Fridrich method is to learn all of the OLL and PLL cases. It's quite common for people to learn F2L through intuition, as it's quite possible come up with the algorithms yourself.</p>
    <p>I recommend learning at least one algorithm for each OLL and PLL case. On cube-algs, it's possible for users to add to the database of algorithms, as well as rate each algorithm. You can also add algorithms for each angle of a case. I've set it up so that the top rated solution for a case is shown on the main screen.</p>
    <strong>Good Luck!</strong>
